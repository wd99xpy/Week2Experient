     * This method works the same as in the tutorial, but I added code to set variables on the PlayerController.
     * 
     * Because Instantiate() returns the GameObject that was created, we can just assign the returned value directly to pc.wielding (our variable that tracks which weapon the player currently has).
     * 
     * We could potentially add more weapons this way!
